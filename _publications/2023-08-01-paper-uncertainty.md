Existing deep [image classification techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/image-classification-techniques "Learn more about image classification techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") strive to suppress data uncertainty for various reasons such as blur, occlusion, noise, and label error and advance to higher accuracy. However, they ignore data uncertainty-induced imprecision and thus do not work as intended. In this paper, we propose a deep open-source framework to mine and reason the imprecision of such training and test sets, which can present better performance and reduce the risk of [misclassification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/misclassification "Learn more about misclassification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). First, we design a label reassignment mechanism. It allows the network to reassign training labels and allow imperfect [training samples](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/training-sample "Learn more about training samples from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with multiple labels. As a result, they are removed from the original classes and considered new imprecise samples to represent partial ignorance. Second, we propose a new [imbalanced data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/imbalanced-data "Learn more about imbalanced data from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") enhancement architecture to learn a generalized representation of each (precise and imprecise) class. It helps the network fuse the [auxiliary information](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/auxiliary-information "Learn more about auxiliary information from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") from both precise and imprecise classes, which is beneficial to extract more distinctive class features from single-labeled samples and characterize uncertainty-induced imprecision in the test set by imprecise test samples. Afterward, methodological analyses and empirical evaluations are conducted. The proposed framework is demonstrated to present better performance on different typical networks (Resnet50, [MobileNetV2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/mobilenetv2 "Learn more about MobileNetV2 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, ShuffleNetV2, SENet, SqueezeNet, Xception) based on five publicly available datasets (Imagewoof-5, Flowers, Monkey, Butterfly, and Cifar-10). In addition, several targeted deep techniques for uncertain images or imprecise results are also employed as comparisons to prove the superiority of the proposed framework.
