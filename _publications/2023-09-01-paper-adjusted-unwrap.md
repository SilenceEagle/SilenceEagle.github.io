Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems based on phase-sensitive optical [time domain reflectometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/time-domain-reflectometry "Learn more about time domain reflectometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (Î¦-OTDR) measure [acoustic waves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/acoustic-wave "Learn more about acoustic waves from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") by demodulating the phase variations of the [Rayleigh backscattering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/rayleigh-backscattering "Learn more about Rayleigh backscattering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (RBS) signals in a [sensing optical fiber](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/optical-fiber-sensing "Learn more about sensing optical fiber from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). However, in harsh environments, strong environmental background interference, coupled with the interference fading of the RBS, would introduce severe distortions in DAS signal that cannot be corrected or even can be worsened by phase unwrapping, thus resulting in low [signal to noise ratio](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/signal-to-noise-ratio "Learn more about signal to noise ratio from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (SNR) and even undetectable signal. In this work, a novel method based on trend prediction is proposed to correct the distortions induced by phase unwrapping error around the fading points. The method is further validated in processing the data acquired from a [field test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/field-test "Learn more about field test from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") performed in ocean environments using a home-built DAS system. By locating and erasing the distortion points, and then detrending, the acoustic signal buried in strong environmental background interference is retrieved with an SNR improvement greater than 10 dB. The results show that the proposed phase correction method can effectively enhance DAS's SNR for those challenging applications with strong background interference.
